# LED-Matrix-Display-on-Sense-HAT-Emulator
A python program to display (scrolling) text in Sense HAT LED matrix display and executing it in the Sense HAT emulator. 

SENSE HAT:
The Sense HAT is an add-on board for Raspberry Pi, made especially for the Astro Pi mission. It has an 8Ã—8 RGB LED matrix, a five-button joystick and includes sensors like Gyroscope, Accelerometer, Humidity, Temperature, Magnetometer etc.  
In a nutshell a HAT is a rectangular board (65x56mm) that has four mounting holes in the (nicely rounded) corners that align with the mounting holes on the B+, has a 40W GPIO header and supports the special autoconfiguration system that allows automatic GPIO setup and driver setup.

In this program, I have displayed the text "SRM IST".
For the same, I have used two different apporaches. Both methods' code and execution can be accessed in the links provided below:
